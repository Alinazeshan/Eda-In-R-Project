# Eda-In-R-Project

## Project Overview
In this project,  R programming language is used and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

## Why this Project?

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the numerical and graphical examination of data characteristics and relationships before formal, rigorous statistical analyses are applied.

EDA can lead to insights, which may uncover to other questions, and eventually predictive models. It also is an important “line of defense” against bad data and is an opportunity to notice that your assumptions or intuitions about a data set are violated.

## What will I learn?
After completing the project, you will:

Understand the distribution of a variable and to check for anomalies and outliers
Learn how to quantify and visualize individual variables within a data set by using appropriate plots such as scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, and box plots
Explore variables to identify the most important variables and relationships within a data set before building predictive models; calculate correlations, and investigate conditional means
Learn powerful methods and visualizations for examining relationships among multiple variables, such as reshaping data frames and using aesthetics like color and shape to uncover more information

## What do I need to install?

Install R. You can download and install R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).
After installing R, you will need to download and install R Studio. Choose the appropriate installation for your operating system.

## Document your Analysis
You will want to document your exploration and analysis in an RMD file which you will submit. That file should be formatted in markdown and should contain (in order):

A stream-of-consciousness analysis and exploration of the data.

a. Headings and text should organize your thoughts and reflect your analysis as you explored the data.

b. Plots in this analysis do not need to be polished with labels, units, and titles; these plots are exploratory (quick and dirty). They should, however, be of the appropriate type and effectively convey the information you glean from them.

c. You can iterate on a plot in the same R chunk, but you don’t need to show every plot iteration in your analysis.

A section at the end called “Final Plots and Summary”

You will select three plots from your analysis to polish and share in this section. The three plots should show different trends and should be polished with appropriate labels, units, and titles (see the Project Rubric for more information).

A final section called “Reflection”

This should contain a few sentences about your struggles, successes, and ideas for future exploration on the data set (see the Project Rubric for more information).
